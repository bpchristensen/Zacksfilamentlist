    <!-- S Tier -->
    <tr>
      <td><strong>S</strong></td>
      <td title="PCTG: Like PETG but stronger, easier to print, more impact resistant, and better layer adhesion. Nearly a perfect filament.">PCTG</td>
      <td title="Tough PLA: PLA blended with PBT. Impact-resistant, resists shattering and heat, great for light-duty functional parts.">Tough PLA</td>
      <td title="Carbon Fiber PETG: Less warping than regular PETG, strong and stiff, ideal for functional prototypes.">CF PETG</td>
      <td title="Carbon Fiber PLA: Matte finish, crisp detail, stiffer but more brittle than standard PLA. Requires hardened nozzle.">CF PLA</td>
      <td title="High-Speed PLA: Lower melting temp, faster flow rate for ultra-quick prints. May be heat sensitive.">High-Speed PLA</td>
      <td title="Glass-Filled Nylon: Very rigid, abrasion- and heat-resistant, often used as a substitute for machined aluminum. Needs high-end printer.">Glass-Filled Nylon</td>
      <td title="TPU (High Durometer): Extremely tough and flexible, nearly indestructible, perfect for combat bots and rugged applications.">TPU (High Durometer)</td>

      <td><strong>A</strong></td>
      <td title="ULTEM 1010: Extremely tough, stable, and heat-resistant. Great across all metrics but very hard to print.">ULTEM 1010</td>
      <td title="ASA: Weather-resistant, UV-stable, tough like ABS but easier to print and with a matte finish.">ASA</td>
      <td title="CF Polycarbonate: Very stiff and strong; good for high-load parts. Requires powerful extruder and high temps.">CF PC</td>
      <td title="PEKK: Super strong, chemically resistant, easier to print than PEEK.">PEKK</td>
      <td title="PC-PBT: Easy-to-print polycarbonate blend, strong and resilient even in cold weather.">PC-PBT</td>
      <td title="SEBS: Stretchy and flexible, smooth to print. A modern alternative to TPE with better results.">SEBS</td>
      <td title="PETG: General-purpose filament; tougher than PLA, transparent options available, but tricky with overhangs.">PETG</td>

      <td title="PA12 Nylon: Hotter and stiffer than PA6. Best for precision rigid parts.">PA12 Nylon</td>
      <td title="CF Nylon (PA6): Stiffens PA6 and reduces warping. Still requires high-end hardware.">CF Nylon</td>
      <td title="GF Polypropylene: Tough, lightweight, difficult to print. Often used industrially.">GF-PP</td>
      <td title="ABS: Strong, tough, vapor-smoothable. Warps heavily and off-gasses.">ABS</td>
      <td title="HIPS: Lightweight, slightly flexible, useful as support material with ASA and ABS.">HIPS</td>

      <td title="Wood PLA: Contains wood particles. Visually convincing but weak and moisture-sensitive.">Wood PLA</td>
      <td title="Matte PLA: Plant-fiber composite, paintable and springy, but prone to jamming.">Matte PLA</td>
      <td title="Silk PLA: Shiny, decorative filament with poor strength. Used for visual models.">Silk PLA</td>
      <td title="Standard PLA: Very easy to print, stiff, but brittle and not heat-resistant.">PLA</td>

      <td title="PPS: Chemically resistant up to 200°C. Expensive but practical for lab use.">PPS</td>
      <td title="PMMA (Acrylic): Extremely clear, UV resistant, brittle and difficult to print.">PMMA</td>
      <td title="OBC: Flexible, tough, less warping than PP, but bed adhesion is poor.">OBC</td>
      <td title="Nylon/PETG Alloys: Attempts to combine toughness of nylon and printability of PETG. Ends up with both weaknesses.">Nylon-PETG Alloys</td>
